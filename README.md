####Directories and link mapping
###### /angular

The /app directory is the uncompressed, unminified version of my portfolio site.  You can find it at <http://angular.ianmphipps.com/>

From this dir, if you

    npm install
    grunt build

you will have a /runtime directory that is compressed and minified.  This can be found at my root site <http://ianmphipps.com/>

###### /backbone

This directory has a backbone version of the same site with some minor differences.  I stopped supporting it once I moved my site over to angular.

Live code can be found at <http://backbone.ianmphipps.com/>

###### /demos

This dir has some demos that I've worked on/built quickly.  Live code can be found at <http://demo.ianphipps.com/> with the directory trailing (/taxes)
