        	<h3>About Ian</h3>
        	<p>     I make websites.</p>
        	<p>     While, there is more that captivates me than the internet, my interests go beyond the scope of this portfolio site. For more information on me, see my <a href="#!/resume">cv</a> on this site.  See <a href="#">work</a> that I've been a part of and/or spearheaded. Follow the links below to different facets of my active life, most of them have publicly accessible data.
			</p>
			<p>     The internet appears to be making us more accountable, better at collaborating, a most cohesive humanity. While most people have preocupations about the internet and its use, I remain hopeful.  As you read this, people are helping each other throughout this beautiful internet. Next steps are to automate the manufacturing of energy and to clean up the planet.</p>
			<p>     I intend to remain involved.</p>
